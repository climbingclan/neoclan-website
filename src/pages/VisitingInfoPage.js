            <h4>Address</h4>
            <p>The address is: <a href="http://maps.apple.com/?address=3+Werneth+Avenue,+M14+7BF&t=m">3 Werneth Avenue, M14 7BF</a></p>
            <h4>How can we help when we come to visit?</h4>
            <p>It&apos;s likely to be a form of chaos when you arrive, and to help ease the load, we&apos;re asking everyone who visits to please:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Bring a meal</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Jen doesn&rsquo;t eat anything with traces of Gluten. She&rsquo;s a celiac.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Tim doesn&rsquo;t eat meat or fish. He&rsquo;s vegetarian.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Takeaways are fine - just please be really careful with the Gluten-ness, cos many places aren't</p>
                        </li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Do a job or task whilst you&apos;re here:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Wash Up</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Do some laundry</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Take out the rubbish/recycling</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Clean something</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Stuff that keeps the house going</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Ask us if there&rsquo;s anything you can get from a shop en-route?</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Letting Tim and/or Jen have a nap whilst you mind the baby</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Can Children and/or Dogs come?</h4>
            <p>Children and Dogs with well behaved adults are very welcome. Make sure we know who's coming so we can accommodate you all.</p>
            <h4>Do I need to be well/clean?</h4>
            <p>Try to be somewhat clean. We&apos;re keen to expose it to as many illnesses and sickness as possible AFTER they&apos;ve had their vaccinations. We&apos;d probably prefer you didn&apos;t kiss the baby unless you&apos;re related to it.</p>

            <h4>Parking</h4>
            <p>It&rsquo;s best to park on Yew Tree Road. <br />There isn&rsquo;t much space on our drive, and our cul de sac has no parking. You can quickly spot the right house from the massive white van in the garden.</p>
            <h4>Shoes</h4>
            <p>If your shoes aren&rsquo;t massively muddy, feel free to keep them on in the house. If they&rsquo;re a bit mucky, or you&rsquo;d prefer to take them off - leave them by the door.</p>
            <h4>Toilet</h4>
            <p>The toilet is at the top of the stairs and on the right. </p>
            <p>Feel free to have a shower if you&rsquo;ve brought your own towel. ðŸ™‚</p>
            <h4>Tea and Food</h4>
            <p>Baby is likely drinking mummy-breast-milk. Breastfeeding Jen gets priority in everything at all times.</p>
            <p>Help yourself to tea (cupboard above microwave) and squash (by sink). </p>
            <p>Tim and Jen both drink decaf tea with plenty of milk and no sugar.</p>
            <p>Sweets and biscuits are on top of the freezer on the left in the box. Savoury snacks are in the cupboard called &ldquo;caving practice&rdquo;. </p>
            <p>Help yourself to anything you want to eat (including full meals). Feel free to eat anything and finish any leftover packets etc, just let us know so we know to restock.</p>
            <h4>TV &amp; Alexa</h4>
            <p>The TV has two remotes - the big TV remote and the small firestick remote. Watch anything you want. We have Alexa in the kitchen. Feel free to ask her to play you music.</p>
            <h4>Smoking &amp; Vaping</h4>
            <p>Feel free to smoke or vape in the front or back garden. The right hand back door opens easily for access to the back garden.</p>
            <h4>What to expect</h4>
            <p>Babies generally do the same sorts of things:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Sleep</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Feed</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Cry</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Have their nappy changed</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Have a bath</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>They do many of these things in rapid cycles. James does these too.</p>
