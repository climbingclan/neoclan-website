            <h1>Household Maintenance</h1>
            <h4>Washing up</h4>
            <p>The washing up always needs doing. Most of the cupboards are labelled as to where stuff should be put away. Have a go.</p>
            <h4>Bin Collections &amp; Recycling</h4>
            <p>Our internal recycling and bins are to the right of the sink. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Green waste on Window sill</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>General waste in tall cylinder bin</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Paper in one box on the floor by the door</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Plastic and metal in one box on the floor by the door.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>The recycling bins are out of the back door and round the right of the house. We have a mixed metal/plastic recycling(brown), paper recycling(blue), food recycling (green), and general waste (black). They are put out in the cul de sac every Thursday for collection on Friday. There&rsquo;s a weird schedule (on the fridge) we&rsquo;re likely to forget.</p>
            <h4>Laundry</h4>
            <p>We have a super cool washing machine. It&rsquo;s very simple to use.</p>
            <p>Put stuff in it, put a tablet thing from the draw next to it in, and let it go.</p>
            <p>We have a clothes line in the garden.</p>
            <p>Clean Laundry goes in Tim and Jen&rsquo;s room. Leave it on the bed for us to put away please.</p>
            <h4>Food Delivery</h4>
            <p>We have a Sainsburys account for ordering food. The email is timandjen@tdobson.net</p>
            <h4>Label Stuff</h4>
            <p>Our house is amusingly labelled already, but it can be very helpful to document where to find what. If something isn&rsquo;t obvious, feel free to add your own labels. <br />There should be labels in the draw called Narnia.</p>
            <h4>Cleaning supplies</h4>
            <p>Cleaning supplies and vacuum cleaners etc are generally in the kitchen and in the cupboard under the sink or under the stairs. Feel free to make use of them, but potentially check about disturbing sleeping babies first.</p>
